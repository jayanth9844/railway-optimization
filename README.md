## 🌟 Overview

This project combines computer network simulation and machine learning to optimize railway operations. It focuses on three key areas:
1. Dynamic Routing
2. Delay Propagation Analysis
3. Energy Optimization

By integrating these components, we aim to create a more efficient, adaptive, and environmentally friendly railway system.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Dynamic Routing
- Real-time route adjustment based on network conditions
- Balances traffic across the network to minimize congestion

### 2. Delay Propagation Analysis
- Predicts the impact of delays on the entire network
- Provides proactive solutions to minimize cascading delays

### 3. Energy Optimization
- Suggests optimal speed profiles for trains
- Reduces overall energy consumption without compromising schedules

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Network Simulation**: Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Web Interface**: Dash
